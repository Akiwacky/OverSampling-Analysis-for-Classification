# OverSampling-Analysis-for-Classification
Logistic Regression Classification Case study to explore Naive random over-sampling, SMOTE, and ADASYN sampling methods when the data received is imbalanced. 
The aim of the case study was to see if the oversampling analysis would result in greater accuracy and therefore be of better use than working with imbalanced data. Based on the results, the accuracy was better by 7% when the over-sampling methods were not used (i.e I received better results without the over-sampling analysis). However, accuracy is just one measure. I will conduct a second study on the same case study to see if the results are better when compared with other metrics.
